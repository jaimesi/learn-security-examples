Briefly explain the vulnerability and why the secure version prevents the vulnerability.

Insecure version:
- The session cookie is not marked as httpOnly, which means it can be accessed by client-side scripts.
    - This makes it vulnerable to attacks like cross-site scripting.
- The secret used to sign the session cookie is hardcoded, which is not recommended for security reasons.

Secure version:
- Sets the httpOnly flag to true in the session cookie, preventing client-side scripts from accessing it.
- Uses a dynamic secret key passed as an argument, avoiding hardcoded secrets that could be easily guessed or leaked.
- Sets the sameSite attribute to mitigate cross-site request forgery attacks.
