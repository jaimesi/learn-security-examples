- Briefly explain the vulnerability and why the secure version is better at preventing repudiation than the insecure version.

The code in insecure.js lacks proper authentication mechanisms for retrieving messages. This
would allow anyone to retrieve messages without any authentication. The code in secure.js
logs requests and messages, which allows administrators to trace actions back to a user or
IP address.

- What additional security mechanisms can you incorporate to prevent such attacks?

- Token-based authentication
- Encryption to protect sensitive data
- Access control so only authorized users can perform certain actions
