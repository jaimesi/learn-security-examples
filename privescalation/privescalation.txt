While both insecure.js and secure.js are vulnerable to privilege escalation, insecure.js
allows users to update their roles without any proper authorization or authentication. Any
user is able to manipulate their role. In secure.js, session-based authentication and
authorization is implemented. It checks if the user is logged in by verifying if there is a
session ID present. It also verifies if the user has administrative privileges.

For additional security measurements:
- Use HTTPS to encrypt data being transmitted between the client and server. This would
prevent tampering.
- Multi-factor authentication for an extra layer of security.
