- Briefly explain the vulnerability and why the secure version prevents the vulnerability.

While both insecure.js and secure.js are vulnerable to NoSQL injection, insecure.js directly
uses 'id' in the MongoDB query without any proper validation. Attackers could potentially
manipulate the query. In secure.js, the code wraps this query in a try-catch block to handle
potential errors.

- What additional security mechanisms can you incorporate to prevent such attacks?

Input validation, cleaning user input by removing any characters that could be used for
injection/attacks, access control to prevent unauthorized access to the data.
