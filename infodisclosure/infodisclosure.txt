Briefly explain the vulnerability and why the secure version prevents the vulnerability.

Insecure.js is vulnerable to NoSQL injection. It directly uses user-provided input in the MongoDB query
without sanitization or validation. This makes it susceptible to injection attacks.

Secure.js prevents NoSQL injection by validating and cleaning the user input. It checks if the username
is a string and then sanitizes it by removing non-alphanumeric characters before querying the database.

Which CIA property does tampering violate?

It violates the integrity property of CIA. By tampering with data or code, the integrity of the system
is compromised as it can lead to unauthorized modifications, potentially causing security breaches.

What additional security mechanisms can you incorporate?

- Input validation and sanitization for all user inputs.
- Logging and monitoring to detect and respond to suspicious activities.
- Encrypting sensitive data at rest and in transit.
